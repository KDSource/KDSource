This is source version of KDSource, a tool for Monte Carlo particle sources generation
using Kernel Density Estimation. Visit our [Documentation Page](https://kdsource.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details!

KDSource assists Monte Carlo beams and shielding calculations, improving tally results in difficult problems. It allows to model big systems (e.g.: investigation reactor guides hall) thru spatial or temporal coupling of different simulations in different transport codes, implementing as well variance reduction.

It processes particle lists recorded as output of a simulation (e.g.: passing thru a window), to be used as input in another one. It estimates density distribution in energy, position and direction by means of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) technique, allowing visualizing it as well as using it to produce new particles (artificial, but with the same estimated density). This allows to increase the number of source particles in the second simulation, improving its statistics (variance reduction).

KDSource uses [`MCPL`](https://mctools.github.io/mcpl/) particle lists format. In its modified version included in this distribution, it allows working with the following Monte Carlo codes:
* MCNP
* PHITS
* McStas
* TRIPOLI-4

In TRIPOLI-4 and McStas it is possible "on-the-fly" sampling during simulations, while for the other formats it is necessary to record the source particle list before the simulation.


## Contents:

The KDSource package consists in the following tools:

* Python API: Allows creating, optimizing, analyzing, plotting, and saving KDE sources. OptimizaciÃ³n consists in automatic selection of bandwidth. Internally, it uses [`KDEpy`](https://kdepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for KDE.

* C API: Allows loading the sources saved with Python, and generating new synthetic samples. These follow the estimated distribution, and can be saved in a new MCPL file or be introduced directly in a simulation.

* Templates and communication files for Monte Carlo codes. Specific files are included for utilization of KDSource tools in McStas y TRIPOLI-4 simulations.

* Command line API: Allows easily producing samples, based on sources saved with Python. Also allows to access templates and communication files, as well as MCPL applications.



## Installation:

Currently, the only implemented installation method is via cloning the GitHub repository and building with CMake and Pip. See bellow for specifical instructions for Linux and Windows.

### Linux and Mac

Requirements: Git 2.14+, GCC 9+, CMake 3+, Pip 22+ (Python 3.8+), LibXml2 2.9.3.

If you are on Linux OS you can install `libxml2` with:

```bash
   $ sudo apt-get update
   $ sudo apt-get install libxml2
```

for Ubuntu, or similarly for other Linux distributions, using the corresponding package manager.

In case you are in MacOS `libxml2` can be installed by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
   $ brew install libxml2
```
The following mandatory steps are valid for both MacOS and linux systems:

1. First of all, clone this repository with all its submodules to a local repository.

   ```bash
   $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KDSource/KDSource
   ```

2. Go to source directory and install with `cmake`:

   ```bash
   $ cd /path/to/kdsourcesource
   $ mkdir build && cd build
   $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/kdsourceinstall
   $ make install
   $ cd ..
   ```
   Where `/path/to/kdsourcesource` is the folder where the source distribution of KDSource was cloned, and `/path/to/kdsourceinstall` is the folder where you wish to install KDSource internal files.

3. Install Python API with `pip`:

   ```bash
   $ cd python
   $ pip install .
   $ cd ..
   ```

4. KDSource is ready to be used in `/path/to/kdsourceinstall`. For example, you can see the `kdtool` command options with:

   ```bash
   $ /path/to/kdsourceinstall/bin/kdtool --help
   ```

   If you wish to have KDSource tools available in your path, execute:

   ```bash
   $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/kdsourceinstall/bin
   ```
   Or add this command to `~/.profile` (and update with `source ~/.profile`).


### Windows

Requirements: Git 2.14+, MinGW-GCC 11+, CMake 3+, Pip 22+ (Python 3.8+), LibXml2 2.9.3.

You can install KDSource, including LibXml2, using the `INSTALL.ps1` PowerShell script:
   ```bash
   > .\INSTALL.ps1
   ```
The script requires 7-Zip, with `7z` command in the system path.

If you prefer a step-by-step approach, you can download `libxml2` in the following link:
* 64 bits: http://xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/64bit/
* 32 bits: http://xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/
Download and extract the `libxml2` and `iconv` archives, and add the path to the `bin` subdirectory of each library to the system `PATH` variable.

Important: The architecture (32 vs 64 bits) of the installed `libxml2` and `iconv` must be the same as the MinGW and CMake architecture. Also make sure that other `libxml2` or `iconv` files with different architecture are not in the `PATH`, or at least not ahead of the ones to be used.

The following instructions use the PowerShell command prompt, and therefore assume that the `bin` subdirectory of Git, MinGW and CMake are in the system `PATH`.

1. First of all, clone this repository with all its submodules to a local repository.

   ```bash
   > git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KDSource/KDSource
   ```

2. Go to source directory and install with `cmake`:

   ```bash
   > cd C:\\path\\to\\kdsourcesource
   > mkdir build && cd build
   > cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\\path\\to\\kdsourceinstall -G "MinGW Makefiles"
   > set C_INCLUDE_PATH=C:\\path\\to\\iconv\\include
   > mingw32-make install
   > cd ..
   ```
   Where `C:\\path\\to\\kdsourcesource` is the folder where the source distribution of KDSource was cloned, and `C:\\path\\to\\kdsourceinstall` is the folder where you wish to install KDSource internal files. `C:\\path\\to\\iconv` is the folder where `iconv` was extracted.

3. Add the `C:\\path\\to\\kdsourceinstall\lib` subdirectory to the system `PATH`.

4. Install Python API with `pip`:

   ```bash
   > cd python
   > pip install .
   > cd ..
   ```

5. KDSource is ready to be used in `C:\\path\\to\\kdsourceinstall`. For example, you can see the `kdtool-resample` command options with:

   ```bash
   > C:\\path\\to\\kdsourceinstall\\bin\\kdtool-resample --help
   ```

   If you wish to have KDSource tools available in your path, add the `bin` subdirectory to the system `PATH`.

   Note: Currently, the `kdtool` application is not available on Windows, but the resampling tool can be invoked directly with `kdtool-resample`, as shown in the example above.
